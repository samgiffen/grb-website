            <p>When we stare into the night sky, we see the glistening stars shine back at us, with little other things for our measly eyes to pick up. But beyond our eyes there lies whole other worlds, and in one of those Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB's) live. As a result of our advancements in technology over the past century or so, we have been able to peer into the high energy world of GRBS, but our initial discovery of them was purely by accident in the late 1960's. The US Vela military satellites were initially designed to detect nuclear weapon tests, but they recorded these abnormal flashes of GRB's. With their initial discovery the public wouldn't know about them until 1973 due to security reasons, when the first paper was finally published. These have been vital in helping us shape our understanding of the universe, as they have given us insight into the boundaries of physics, while also helping us peer into the early universe to see what it was like billions of years ago.</p>

            <h2>So What are GRB's?</h2>
            <p>While GRB's are all extremely high energy bursts of gamma-rays, there are two kinds which are radically different in both how they come about, and what they can tell us. Let's first examine long duration GRB's, which last for ≥ 2 seconds. These typically occur because of stars at least 20-30 times the mass of our sun, which have low metal contents and an extremely high rotation speed, with the core angular momentum needing to be ~ 10<sup>14</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s. After the stars long lived life, it will collapse and likely become a black hole in roughly 1 second, while also forming an accretion disk which has a mass of .1 – 10 solar masses, which feeds jets streaming out of the black hole. With the energy present these can become some of the brightest events in the galaxy with an energy output of ~ 10<sup>44</sup>-10<sup>47</sup> watts, while also converting much of that energy into gamma rays which have a Lorentz factor Γ of roughly 100-1000. The brightest GRB recorded was a long duration GRB, known as GRB 221009A, or BOAT (Brightest of All Time), which occurred in 2022 over the course of about seven minutes.</p>

            <p>Short duration GRB's are born from comparatively much smaller objects, where some combination of Neutron star(s) and Black Hole(s), and last < 2 seconds. If two neutron stars merge with one another they will for a moment become a hyper massive neutron star, before realizing that they can't sustain themselves and subsequently collapsing into a black hole, with all other mergers between neutron stars and black holes or just black holes resulting in another black hole. The masses present are far smaller than those needed for long duration GRB's, with the combined mass of the merging objects ranging typically from 5-20 solar masses. Along with the new merged object there is a accretion disk of roughly .01-.3 solar masses, once again a far smaller mass than that of long duration GRB's accretion disk. These events lead to a peak luminosity of ~ 10<sup>43</sup>-10<sup>45</sup> watts, lower than that found in long duration GRB's, and the jets of gamma rays produced only having a Lorentz factor Γ of roughly 50-200.</p>

            <h2>How do we find GRB's?</h2>
            <p>Initially satellites like NASA's Swift and Fermi have the capabilities to detect a GRB, and within seconds of detecting one determines a precise location from which it could have originated. Once these satellites have found the area from which the GRB originated, it signals to ground telescopes across the world to shift the way they're orientated to the area and simply observe for any more detections. Due to the limited timing nature that GRB's often exhibit, the systems in place to detect them must move quickly, because every second matters in being able to view these often short lived events. These satellites are often looking for afterglows, which are slower fading emissions at longer wavelengths which are a byproduct of the collisions between interstellar gas and material being ejected in the waves, as the gamma rays generated are often destroyed within our own atmosphere. These telescopes also begin to analyze the true location of the GRB, which can then be used to pinpoint how long ago these truly occurred.</p>

            <h2>What do they tell us?</h2>
            <p>GRB's can be incredibly useful for us when trying to analyze early universe conditions. GRB's with a redshift greater than six allow us a glimpse into the incredibly early galaxy, with those occurring within the first billion years of the universe's existence. This allows us to observe some of the earliest stars in the universe, and their lives which can be pivotal to help us understand the true origins of our universe. On top of this, short duration GRB's can be used to help us pinpoint the origin heavy elements in the universe because of them typically occurring as a result of neutron stars merging. These often form heavy elements, which can then be shot off throughout the cosmos, helping to explain how the universe became populated with such materials.</p>
